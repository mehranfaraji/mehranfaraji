# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mehran Faraji

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Junior Data Scientist** with a strong foundation in **Data Analysis**, **Machine Learning Theory**, and **Machine Learning Engineering**. Currently, I'm pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Data Science at the University of Padova, where I refine my expertise in AI and data-driven methodologies.

My passion is developing ML based solutions on a wide range of problems. I have hands-on experience with cloud infrastructures enabling me to deploy my solutions.

Throughout my journey, I have focused on three key areas:

- **Data Analysis**: Skilled at transforming raw data into meaningful insights using languages and tools such as Python, R, Excel, Power BI, Pandas, and Matplotlib. My analytical approach ensures data-driven decision-making and in-depth understanding.

- **Machine Learning Theory**: Proficient in reading and implementing research papers, I have a deep understanding of the theoretical foundations behind machine learning models. This enables me to develop and adapt complex algorithms based on the latest research advancements.

- **Machine Learning Engineering**: Experienced in building end-to-end pipelines, from model development to deployment. I excel at implementing complex models, creating APIs, and deploying solutions that directly serve end users.
